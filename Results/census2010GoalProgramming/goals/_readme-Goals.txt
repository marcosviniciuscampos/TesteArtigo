Each row in this file has a goal. The values in each row are separated by semicolons, which can be converted into columns. 

Thus, the first column identifies the goal. The next three columns show the target values for the objectives of maximising the coverage of the demand, minimising the total distance traveled weighted by the number of users and minimising the inequity in access, respectively.
