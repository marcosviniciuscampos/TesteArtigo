For each instance, there is a file representing the combined front as follows:

combinedFront_<INSTANCE_NAME>.csv

Each row represents a non-dominated solution in the combined front.

The values in each row are separated by semicolons, which can be converted into columns. 

Thus, the first three columns represent the target values for the objectives of maximising the coverage of the demand, minimising the total distance traveled weighted by the number of users and minimising the inequity in access, respectively. The last column shows the origin of the solution.
