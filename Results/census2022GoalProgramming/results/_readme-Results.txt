For each instance in its respective folder there are the following files:

results_<INSTANCE NAME>_GP.csv=> This file brings the results for the pre-defined 1000 goals using Goal Programming model. The first value identify the goal. The values obtained for each objective of the goal are presented in the following three columns in the following order: coverage of the demanda, weighted distance and inequity in access


s_<INSTANCE_NAME>_GP_goal<GOAL_ID>_log.log		=> Log generated by the gurobi solver


s_<INSTANCE_NAME>_GP_goal<GOAL_ID>_readable.txt	=> Solution description for human beings. Its content consists of:

- Objective Functions Values
- Number of mammography units per city
- Location and Allocations of mammography units
- Coverage of Demand by city


s_<INSTANCE_NAME>_GP_goal<GOAL_ID>_raw.txt		=> Raw data for each solution. According to the instance size, this file has n + n x n rows. The first n rows represent the values of Y variables. The follow n x n rows bring the results for the X variables in the respective solution.
